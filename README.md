# UFO 50 Save Editor

This is a UFO 50 Save Editor for Windows only. I do not fully endorse using it on your personal save file unless you really know what you are doing. But just in case, the program makes a backup of the currently loaded save to the 'BACKUPS' folder if you overwrite it. Be aware that when the program opens, it will attempt to load the save file stored in the default location at `%LocalAppData%\ufo50\save1.ufo`.
