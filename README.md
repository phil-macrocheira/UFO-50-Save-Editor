# UFO 50 Save Editor

This is a very bare bones UFO 50 Save Editor for Windows only. It exists mainly as a tool for advanced users who are trying to test and understand the game. I do not recommend using it on your personal save file unless you are desperate to fix a bug or something. It is not thoroughly tested and I cannot guarantee that it won't ruin your save. The program makes a backup of the currently loaded save to the 'BACKUPS' folder if you overwrite it. Be aware that when the program opens, it will attempt to load the save file stored in the default location at `%LocalAppData%\ufo50\save1.ufo`.

Note: Many save variables are created in the save as needed, so a typical save does not have all editable variables. All possible variables are not currently known and the editor does not yet support the ability to add or remove entries.
